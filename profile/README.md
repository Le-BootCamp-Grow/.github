# Le BootCamp Grow - Building the Leading Developer Education Platform for Francophones

Welcome to Le BootCamp Grow, the GitHub base for the Growcampus by Aisely developer bootcamp. We are a French-speaking startup on a mission to build the leading developer training and resources platform for francophones, specifically francophone Africans.

Our GitHub organization is an open-source and collaborative project, and it aligns with our mission to provide an extensive collection of high-quality French-speaking learning content and resources for the francophone developer community.

### Why We Started This Project

We started this project in mid-2022 to address a crucial need in our environment and solve a common problem that several million francophones, especially in Africa, face.

The modern world runs on software, yet the vast majority of developer learning content, resources, and communities are English-speaking and mostly targeted towards English speakers. For over 300 million francophones, 70% of whom are Africans, there are too few learning content and resources in French for learning software development. There is barely any developer community or platform helping francophone aspiring developers to acquire in-demand developer skills and begin the developer careers. Unfortunately, this is a significant disadvantage to the francophone African community and economy. Several million francophone children, teens, and youths who passionately aspire to become world-class developers are soon discouraged upon facing the ultimate barrier - the English language!

### Our Mission

We have taken on the magnificient mission of helping every French-speaking youth, teenager, and child who dreams of becoming the next Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, or Sergey Brin to have a chance to make their dreams a reality. And we can only do this by providing high-quality learning content and resources needed to help them become highly-talented, world-class developers.

We are open to contributions from developers from across the globe. We'll be glad to make our mission a reality through the support and contribution of many.

### Our Vision

At Growcampus, our vision is to become the leading developer education platform for francophones globally. We aspire to empower millions of francophones, especially in Africa, with the necessary skills and resources to become world-class developers, and in the process, drive economic growth and innovation across French-speaking communities.

We believe that language should not be a barrier to learning, and that the lack of French-speaking learning content and resources in software development is a critical issue that needs to be addressed urgently. Our vision is to make high-quality French-speaking developer training and resources readily available to every French-speaking youth, teenager, and child, regardless of their location and background.

To achieve this vision, we are committed to building a vibrant and inclusive developer community that fosters collaboration, innovation, and excellence. We envision a world where every French-speaking developer has access to a thriving ecosystem of mentors, peers, and opportunities, and can achieve their full potential as successful and impactful members of the global developer community.

Our vision is ambitious, but we are confident that with the support and contributions of many, we can make it a reality. We are excited about the journey ahead and invite you to join us in building a brighter future for francophones everywhere.

### How You Can Contribute

Contributions can come in different forms, such as code snippets, projects, suggestions, translations, compiled short courses, donations, investment, retweets, and shoutouts. We are grateful for any form of support that keeps us alive and helps us in our mission.

Primarily, this GitHub Organization was created to be an online collection of curricula, projects, course notes, exercises, links, and more for our developer bootcamps. We publish resources for our bootcamps and community here, for the community. Some of these resources are part of our paid programs while the most are part of our Growcampus DevFree program.
