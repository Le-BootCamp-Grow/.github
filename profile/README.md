Le BootCamp Grow is the GitHub base of the Grow by Aisely developer bootcamp. Grow by Aisely is a French-speaking startup building the leading developer bootcamp and resources platform for francophones.

This GitHub base has been created to be an open-source and collaborative project, in line with our mission to provide an extensive collection of high-quality French-speaking learning content and resources for the francophone developer community. 

### Why?

We started this project in mid-2022 to respond to a crucial need in our environment, and to solve a common problem to several millions of francophones, especially in Africa. 

As a matter of fact, the modern world runs on software. Yet, the vast majority of developer learning content, resources and communities are English-speaking and mostly targeted towards English speakers. It is undisputable that English is the choice language of the developer ecosystem globally.

However, for over 300 million francophones, 70% of whom are Africans, there are too few learning content and resources in French language, for learning software development. There is barely any developer community or platform serving francophone developers. Unfortunately, this is of immeasurable disadvantage to the francophone community and economy. Several millions of francophone children, teens and youths who passionately aspire to become word-class developers are soon discouraged upon facing the ultimate barrier - the English language!

### Be part of our journey to help 100 million+ francophones become world-class developers

One sure fact about the problem described above is that it's not described enough. As a matter of fact, we just can't describe it enough. It is much more real and pertinent than we can relate in a few words. Perhaps, the best way to have more concrete insight into this problem is to be a francophone, residing in a francophone economy (haha!).

But we are intimately familiar with this problem. And we have set out to do the needful! We have taken on this grand mission. To help every French-speaking youth, teenager and child who dreams of becoming the next Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, or Sergey Brin to have a chance to make their dreams a reality. And we can only do this by providing high-quality learning content and resources needed to help them become talented, world-class developers.

For this, we are open to contributions from developers from across the globe. We'll be glad to make our mission a reality, through the support and contribution of many.

### What is a contribution?

Well, it doesn't have to be all about `git commit -m 'blah blah blah'`. Your contribution can be just anything, a suggestion, a code snippet, a project, a compiled short course, a donation, a retweet or a shoutout. Anything that will keep us alive and going! 

> Note: Primarily, this GitHub Organization was created to be an online collection of curricula, projects, course notes, exercises, links and so on for our developer bootcamps. We publish the resources for our bootcamps and community here, for the community. Some of these resources constitiute our paid programs, while a lot more will be free resources.
