Le BootCamp Grow is the GitHub base of the Grow by Aisely developer bootcamp. Grow by Aisely is a French-speaking startup building the leading developer bootcamp and resources platform for francophones.

This GitHub base has been created to be open-source and collaborative, being in line with our mission to provide an extensive collection of French-speaking learning content and resources for French-speaking software developers. 

### Why?

We started this project in mid-2022 to respond to a crucial need in our environment, and to solve a common problem to millions of francophone developers, especially in Africa. The vast majority of developer content and resources are in English. We understand that English is the choice language of the developer ecosystem. However, for over 300 million francophones, there are too few developer learning resources in the French-language. There is barely any developer community primariy for francophones. There is a lot of disadvantage that reult from this. Several millions of francophones who aspire to become word-class developers have to learn the English language, **first**!

### Be part of our journey to help 100 million+ become world-class developers

One crucial thing about the problem we described above is that we did't describe the problem enough. As a matter of fact, we just can't. The problem is much more real than we can relate in a few words. Perhaps, the best way to have enough insight into the problem is to be a francophone, living in a francophone region (haha!).

Therefore, we want to do the needful! We want to take on this grand mission. We want every French-speaking youth, teenager and child who dreams of becoming the next Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, or Sergey Brin, to have a chance to make their dreams a reality. And we can only do this by providing all that they need to help them become talented, world-class developers.

We are therefore very much open to contributions from developers from across the globe. We'll be glad to make our mission a reality, through the support and contribution of many.

### What is a contribution?

Well, it doesn't necessarily have to be a `git commit 'blah blah blah'`. Your contribution can be just anything, a suggestion, a code snippet, a project, a compiled short course, a retweet or a shoutout. Anything that will keep us going! 

> Note: Primarily, this base has been created to be a collection of curricula, projects, course notes, exercises, links and so on for our developer bootcamps. We publish the resources for our training here. Some of these are from our paid programs, while a lot more will be free resources.
